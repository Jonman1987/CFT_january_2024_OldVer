Test task for CFT. This utility takes few txt files with different data (integers, floats, string) and sorted data to single files by type of data.
Use:
-p for special prefics of file name
-o for change directory of outputfiles
-a for use rewriting file option
-s for take short statistics of writed data
-f for take full statistics of writed data

Update: Old version of test task for CFT. Today I remake new version with good solutions.
